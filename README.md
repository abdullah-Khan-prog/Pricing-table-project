# Pricing-table-project
Hey there! This is my pricing table using HTML and advanced CSS . I have used CSS Flexbox for the layout and this is also a responsive website. I have attached two goals as goal-large.png and goal-small.png so that if the screen is large then the website will behave like goal large and if the screen is small the website will behave as goal small.
